# wavefront-obj-mesh-package
A set of GNU Octave functions for manipulating triangular meshes in Wavefront obj format

This package is a work in progress, so any feedback would be appreciated. Especially if it concerns bugs.
Further functions will be uploaded as soon as they pass initial testing. Feel free to contribute additional functions with 
relevant functionality or request new functions for manipulating triangular meshes in GNU Octave. 

To use the functions compile them through GNU Octave 'mkoctfile' command.

e.g >> mkoctfile readObj.cc

Use help command to access usage information for each function.

e.g.>> help readObj
